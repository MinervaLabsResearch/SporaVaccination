Vaccinating against Spora ransomware: a proof-of-concept tool by Minerva

## Synopsis

Spora is presently among the most common ransomware families. For instance, it struck countless victims in the fake ["Chrome Font Pack Update" campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-chrome-font-pack-update-alerts-infecting-visitors-with-spora-ransomware/), encrypting victims’ files even without having to communicate over the Internet. Minerva Labs is releasing a proof-of-concept tool that is able to contain Spora infections by generating an infection marker that this ransomware seeks, to determine whether it’s already running on the system.

This is a proof of concept demonstrating how to vaccinate against Spora.
